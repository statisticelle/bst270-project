# bst270-project

The goal of this project is to recreate two figures from a 538 article. 

I chose the article "Congress Today Is Older Than It's Ever Been," which can be accessed at: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/aging-congress-boomers/

1. The first figure, titled "The House and Senate are older than ever before," is a step plot of the median age of Congress members by year and chamber since 1919. 

2. The second figure, titled "Baby boomers are the biggest generation in Congress today," is a stacked area plot of the proportion of Congress members by year and generation.

Raw data was obtained from Github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-demographics
