## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Dependencies

```

Here are the scripts sourced by this project (stored in R subdirectory):
```{r scripts}

```

## Data

Data was originally obtained on Github, and can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-demographics). A full data dictionary is also available at that location (README.md). 

A copy of the data is stored in CSV format within the data subdirectory. Variables relevant to the project, and their description, are also provided with each figure.

```{r import}
raw_df <- read.csv('data/data_aging_congress.csv')
```

```{r process}
work_df <- raw_df %>%
  mutate(year = year(start_date))
```


## Figure 1
```{r}
fig1_df <- work_df %>% 
  group_by(year, chamber) %>%
  summarize(median_age = median(age_years)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
fig1 <- fig1_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=median_age, col=chamber)) +
  geom_step(linewidth=0.75) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1920, 2020, 20), limits = c(1919, 2023)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(45, 65, 5), limits = c(45, 66)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.position = 'top', 
        legend.justification = 'left',
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0)) +
  labs(x='', y='', col='',
       title = "The House and Senate are older than ever before",
       subtitle = "Median age of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House by Congress, 1919 to 2023",
       caption = "Data is based on all members who served in either the Senate or House in each Congress,\nwhich is notated by the year in which it was seated. Any member who served in both chambers\nin the same Congress was assigned to the chamber in which they cast more votes.") 
```

## Figure 2

```{r}
fig2_df <- work_df %>%
  group_by(year, generation) %>%
  summarize(n_gen = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_gen = n_gen / sum(n_gen) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# fig2 <- fig2_df %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x=year, y=prop_gen, fill=generation)) +
#   geom_area(position='stack', alpha=0.75)
# 
# fig2
```
